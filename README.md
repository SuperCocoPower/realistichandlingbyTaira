I am honored to introduce you my handling work (about 300+ hours invest in it). This file is focus on Roleplay Server that looking for a natural move (and kinda exaggerated move in a few cases) of the vehicles (visual and physic),
I developed all of them based in the Real Car, I mean. I investigated about the real car based, and made the handling near to the reality. Be welcome to share your opinion or complains. My inspiration for dev handlings was GTA5Wiseguy , 
I learned thanks to him (If you see this, thanks to you, I could dev the handlings in my own way ).


These handlings are not easy play, I mean, there is some cars that can get 300km/h, dont expect that you can drive easily with that speed in a normal road. 
With this in mind:
I will accept comments about my work, be free to share your opinion. 
If you have some complain, please post it and I will try to fix it ASAP. 
Requests are accept! I will updating all I can, more request mean more people have some interest in my work.
